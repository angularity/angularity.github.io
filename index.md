# *Angularity*

> Angularity is a philosophy of development.

> Our focus is maintaining uniformity of development across groups of corporate developers who hold varying experience levels.

> Our contributors hold a collective vision of best-practice Angular-js development and have condensed this into a set of tools and resources known as **Angularity**.

## Features

Primarily `angularity` is a javascript build tool build on `node-js`. Its features include:

  * [Ecmascript-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript_Harmony_.286th_Edition.29) syntax (using [es6ify](http://thlorenz.github.io/es6ify/))
  * [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) 3.2 (using [libsass](http://libsass.org/))
  * Javascript unit testing (using [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) and [Jasmine 2.0](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html))

At its heart, none of these features are specifically tied to [Angular-js](https://angularjs.org/). However much of the material you will find on this site is geared to Angular development.
