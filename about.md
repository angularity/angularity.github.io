# About

Angularity is a philosophy of development.

Our focus is maintaining uniformity of development across groups of corporate developers who hold varying experience levels.

Our contributors hold a collective vision of best-practice Angular-js development and have condensed this into a set of tools and resources known as **Angularity**.


### You should use *angularity* when..

* You are working with [Angular-js](https://angularjs.org/) and are open to working with [Ecmascript-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript_Harmony_.286th_Edition.29).

* You like [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and there are sufficient SASS mixins for you in the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) library.


### You should avoid *angularity* when..

* You don't want to work with [Ecmascript-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript_Harmony_.286th_Edition.29) or are avoiding the [traceur_runtime](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/CompilingOffline).

* You want to use a CSS preprocessor other than [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).

* You would like to use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) with your SASS.

* You need different custom build steps on each of your applications. They cannot be handled by a uniform build tool.


## Features

Primarily `angularity` is a javascript build tool build on `node-js`. Its features include:

  * [Ecmascript-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript_Harmony_.286th_Edition.29) syntax (using [es6ify](http://thlorenz.github.io/es6ify/))
  * [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) 3.2 (using [libsass](http://libsass.org/))
  * [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) mixin library for SASS.
  * Javascript unit testing (using [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) and [Jasmine 2.0](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html))

At its heart, none of these features are specifically tied to [Angular-js](https://angularjs.org/). However much of the material you will find on this site is geared to Angular development.
